# ![icon](desktop/src/main/assets/icons/icon_32.png) Clover Pixel Dungeon

Clover Pixel Dungeon is a fork of [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/shatteredpd/), an open-source traditional roguelike dungeon crawler with randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use, which in turn was based on [Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://watabou.itch.io).

This fork adds:

- a **wand of anti-magic**, which temporarily suppresses a target's magical abilities;
- a **flying carpet artifact**, for flying over terrain at high speed;
- a **Forgetful challenge**, which makes identification of potions and scrolls temporary;
- a **stone of double enchantment**, which imbues a weapon with two enchantments simultaneously; and
- a rare **four-leaf clover** plant, which grants loot-related luck when trampled.
