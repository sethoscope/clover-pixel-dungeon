# ![icon](desktop/src/main/assets/icons/icon_32.png) Clover Pixel Dungeon

Clover Pixel Dungeon is a fork of [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/shatteredpd/), an open-source traditional roguelike dungeon crawler with randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use, which in turn was based on [Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://www.watabou.ru).

This fork adds:

- a **wand of anti-magic**, which temporarily suppresses a target's magical abilities;
- a **flying carpet** artifact;
- a **Forgetful** challenge, which makes identification of potions and scrolls temporary;
- a **Stone of Double Enchantment**, which imbues a weapon with two enchantments simultaneously; and
- a rare **Four-Leaf Clover** plant, which gives loot-related luck when trampled.
