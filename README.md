# Clover Pixel Dungeon

Clover Pixel Dungeon is a fork of [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/shatteredpd/), an open-source traditional roguelike dungeon crawler with randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use, which in turn was based on [Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://www.watabou.ru).

This fork adds:

- a **wand of anti-magic**, which temporarily suppresses a target's magical abilities,
- a **flying carpet** artifact, and
- a **Forgetful** challenge, which makes identification of potions and scrolls temporary.
